I have never used Go before. I currently mainly code with C# and TypeScript.

I am not familiar with commonly used go code formatting (indentation, alignment) or project structure. I have looked at some example repositories to get an idea.

## Usage

```go
import "form3.tech/form3"
```

## Testing

To run unit tests `go test -run 'Unit'`
To run integration tests `docker-compose up`
